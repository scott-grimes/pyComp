Computer Architecture

Our computer is a 16-bit von Neumann Machine

consists of
* Two blocks of memory. Instruction Memory and Data Memory, 
  each memory block is 16-bit and 32k sized. THe instruction memory
  is read only- loaded from a pre-burnt ROM chip.
* One CPU containing two registers A,D and an ALU (Arithmetic 
  Logic Unit. The CPU also has a program counter PC. The D register
  is used to store data, the A register can be used as a data value, a 
  RAM address or a ROM address.
* Input from a keyboard mapped to the memory address 24576 (0x6000)
* Output to a screen mapped to the base memory address
  at 16384 (0x4000)
  * The output of PC is connected to the address input of the ROM
  chip, so that ROM always emits the instruction ROM[PC]. 
  
Our computer operates on an Execute/Fetch cycle. The first instruction
executes some command, the second instruction is determined by the jump
bits of the previous instruction. If we need to Jump, PC is set to the value
of the A register. If not, PC is incremented by 1. This cycle continues
until the computer is turned off.
